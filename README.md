### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for this website is simple and chosen mainly for accessibility purposes. I have chosen a grey background with white text throughout, with red and yellow buttons for differentiation.

### Typography

For this website I have used the simple sans serif font, Roboto from Google Fonts throughout the website to make all of the text consistent and easy to read.

### Features

### Search Engine Optimisation

I have added meta tags in the head of each page containing descriptions and keywords in order to improve the optimisation, ranking, quality and quantity of the website traffic.

### Homepage 

The homepage for the website shows a simplistic design featuring the title of the page "How well do you know your movies?" followed by a simple image and two clear buttons inviting the user to either click play and start the quiz or to view the leaderboard to see any locally saved scores.

### Main Quiz Page

Upon clicking play, the user is taken to the quiz page, presenting them with the first question of the quiz with four available answer options to choose from. On the top left the user is provided with information on which question they are currently on and how many are remaining. This is also followed by a progress bar which will fill up with green as the game progresses. On the top left, the user is shown their current score. This will go up in increments of 100, depending on how many correct answers they choose. If the user has chosen a correct answer, the answer will flash green. If the user has chosen an incorrect answer, the answer will flash red.

### End page 

Upon completion of the quiz, the user is redirected to the end page where they are met with a form to submit their name and save their score to the leaderboard should they wish to. The save button has been set to disabled until a key is pressed in the input field and a name has been written. If a player does not wish to save their score, if they haven't done as well as they had hoped for example, they are able to click the play again button and try again. Alternatively, they can choose to click on the home button and be redirected to the home page. The top left of the page shows the score that they ended with.

The leaderboard page can be accessed from the homepage, upon completion of the form on the end page users are redirected to the homepage where they can click on the leaderboard. The leaderboard will show a list of high scores previously saved by the user, encouraging players to save their scores to reach the top of the leaderboard.

### Future Developments

In future developments, I would like to add more questions to the quiz so that users can test their knowledge further. It would also be helpful to make the leaderboard save scores globally as it currently only shows scores saved locally on the same device, this development would allow users to play more competitively across the globe.
